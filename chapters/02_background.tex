\chapter{Theoretical Background}%
\label{cha:background}

This chapter will give an overview of the theoretical background of the problem
investigated in this thesis, as well as the methods used. We will first
introduce the topic of outliers on an intuitive level and then try to highlight
a more rigorous approach. We will move on to introduce neural network models
especially in their invertible variant and how specific training schemes are
particularly useful for investigating outliers. Finally we will introduce
archetypal analysis as a general concept and also as an add-on to more
complicated models.
